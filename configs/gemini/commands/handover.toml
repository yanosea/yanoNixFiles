# Session handover note generator

prompt = """
Generate a `HANDOVER.md` at the project root to carry context to the next session.

- If `HANDOVER.md` already exists, overwrite it (previous content is not needed).

## HANDOVER.md structure

Include all of the following sections:

### What was done

- Work performed and progress, in bullet points

### Decisions made

- Confirmed design decisions, policies, rules, etc.

### Rejected alternatives and reasons

- Approaches considered but not adopted, with reasons

### Pitfalls encountered

- Sticking points, errors, unexpected behavior, etc.

### Lessons learned

- Insights and discoveries from this session

### Next steps

- Incomplete tasks and what to start in the next session
- Include priority order

### Related files

- List of main file paths touched in this session

## Rules

- Keep it concise. No long paragraphs.
- Use bullet points throughout.
- Avoid speculation or vague wording. Write facts only.
- "Rejected alternatives and reasons" is especially important to prevent repeating the same discussion in the next session.

**IMPORTANT: HANDOVER.md must be in English, but your reply must be in Japanese.**
